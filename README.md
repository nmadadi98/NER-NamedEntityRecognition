# NLP with Bidirectional LSTM and Glove Embeddings

## Overview
This repository hosts the implementation for the NLP assignment from CSCI544. The project focuses on building and evaluating models for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using Bidirectional LSTM and Glove Embeddings on the CoNLL-2003 dataset. The assignment explores the efficacy of different deep learning techniques in NLP tasks.

## Tasks
- **Task 1**: Developing a Bidirectional LSTM model for NER. Includes model architecture, training process, and performance evaluation.
- **Task 2**: Enhancing the Bidirectional LSTM model with Glove Embeddings.

## Dataset
Utilizes the CoNLL-2003 corpus, providing practical experience in handling real-world NLP data.
